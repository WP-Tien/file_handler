# Important Considerations
### File Pointer: 
When you write to a file, the file pointer moves to the end. If you want to read from the same file after writing, you need to move the pointer back to the beginning using file.Seek(0, io.SeekStart).

### Error Handling: 
Always check for errors after each file operation.
Closing Files: Use defer file.Close() to ensure the file is closed after use.
### Buffering: 
bufio provides buffered input and output, which can improve performance, especially for line-by-line operations.
### Concurrency: 
If multiple goroutines need to access the same file concurrently, use a mutex to prevent data corruption.
### File Modes: When opening a file, consider using appropriate flags such as:
- os.O_RDONLY: Read-only mode.
- os.O_WRONLY: Write-only mode.
- os.O_RDWR: Read and write mode.
- os.O_APPEND: Append data to the end of the file.
- os.O_CREATE: Create the file if it doesn't exist.
- os.O_TRUNC: Truncate the file to zero length.
- io.EOF: When reading from a file, io.EOF signals the end of the file.
